Currently contributing is very difficult.
There is not an easy way to test your code before submitting.  
But if you still wish to help contribute, please do so by all means!
  
Campbell would appreciate it however, if you please try to keep the amount of code to review in a pull request to a minimum in order to make it easier to review.
Also, please ensure you are following the code of conduct.
  
That's it! Thanks for contributing!
